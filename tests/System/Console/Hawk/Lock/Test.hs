-- | Use `withLock` around critical sections which cannot run in parallel with
--   other instances of hawk.
-- 
-- In the ideal case, nobody else is trying to use `withLock`.
-- 
-- >>> withLock print3

-- 3
-- 
-- If two instances of hawk are trying to use same resource (here stdout) at
-- the same time, problems can occur.
-- (test disabled because the unlocked behaviour isn't deterministic)
-- 
-- -- >>> print3 `par` print3
-- -- 1
-- -- 1
-- -- 2
-- -- 2
-- -- 3

-- 
-- By using `withLock`, we serialize the execution of the two critical sections.
-- 
-- >>> withLock print3 `par` withLock print3
-- 1
-- 2
-- 3
-- 1
-- 2
-- 3
-- 
-- There is a verbose version of `withLock` which makes it easy to see when
-- two instances are trying to enter `withLock` at the same time.

-- Here is a variant of the previous test which tests a race condition in which
-- instance 1 releases the lock immediately after instance 2 notices that the
-- lock is busy, but before instance 2 begins waiting for the lock to be released.
-- 
-- This test case has been covered with filelock, the second process will be blocked
-- at any point if the first process is running.
